## Abstract

The project aims to integrate various critical as well as practical additions to a basic helmet to
create a Smart Helmet. One of the biggest risks associated with two wheeler usage is the
exposed nature of travel that puts one at immense risk in case of an accident.
With top priority given to safety, our primary feature includes installing FSR (Force Sensitive
Resistors) on the interior of the helmet. In the case of an impact/accident, the GSM module will
relay the GPS coordinates of the person to predefined emergency contacts. This feature is
crucial, as a delay in timely first aid is one of the leading causes of fatality in two wheeler
accidents.
Additionally, the Smart Helmet will be equipped with a camera module that can be used to
record video/pictures. This feature can be used extensively by adventure enthusiasts to
document their trails as well as casual users.
Mobile Application and Cloud Integration - The Smart Helmet will have a mobile application.
The application can be used to establish the safety contacts, to access the recorded
photos/videos and have an integration with Google Maps API.
